### Example1: 
- A man spends 75% of his income, when his income is increased by 20%, he increases his expenditure by 10%. By how much per cent are his savings increased.

**Ans:** Let the income of the man = x
then expenditure = 0.75x and savings = 0.25x
now after 20 % increment income = 1.2x and with 10 % increment in the expenditure it will be 0.75x*1.1 = 0.825x
so savings = 1.2x - 0.825x = 0.375x
so new % of savings relative to new income = (0.375x/1.2x)*100
= 0.3125*100 = 31.25 %

### Example2:
- Jack consumes 75% of his salary. Later his salary is increased by 20% and he increases his expenditures by 10%. Find the percentage increase in his savings.

**Ans:** Let Jack's original salary be Rs 100. 

Then, his expenditure = Rs 75, 

his savings = Rs 25. 

Now, his new salary = Rs 120. 

So, new expenditure = (110/100) × 75 = Rs 165/2, 

new savings = 120 - 165/2 = Rs 75/2. 

Increase in savings = 75/2 - 25 = Rs 25/2. 

Therefore, percentage increase in savings = ((25/2)/25) × 100% = 50%.
